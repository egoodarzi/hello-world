## Types of Indicator
### There are two basic types of technical indicators:

1. **Overlays:** Technical indicators that use the same scale as prices are plotted over the top of the prices on a stock chart. Examples include moving averages and Bollinger Bands.

2. **Oscillators:** Technical indicators that oscillate between a local minimum and maximum are plotted above or below a price chart. Examples include the stochastic oscillator, MACD or RSI.

- A technical indicator is a series of data points that are derived by applying a formula to the price data of a security. 
Price data includes any combination of the open, high, low or close over a period of time. Some indicators may use only the closing prices, while others incorporate volume and open interest into their formulas.
