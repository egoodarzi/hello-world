## Types of Indicator
### There are two basic types of technical indicators:

1. **Overlays:** Technical indicators that use the same scale as prices are plotted over the top of the prices on a stock chart. Examples include moving averages and Bollinger Bands.

2. **Oscillators:** Technical indicators that oscillate between a local minimum and maximum are plotted above or below a price chart. Examples include the stochastic oscillator, MACD or RSI.
