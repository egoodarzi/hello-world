# Statistical V.S. practical Significance [source](https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/practical-statistical-significance/#:~:text=While%20statistical%20significance%20relates%20to,in%20your%20field%20of%20study.)

Statistical significance **does not** necessarily mean that the results are 
practically significant in a real-worls sense of importance.

 it might seem logical that p-values and statistical significance relate to importance. However, that is **false** because conditions other than large effect sizes can produce tiny p-values.

## Practical Significance
While statistical significance relates to whether an effect exists, practical significance refers to the magnitude of the effect.
However, no statistical test can tell you whether the effect is large enough to be important in your field of study. Instead, you need to apply your subject area knowledge and expertise to determine whether the effect is big enough to be meaningful in the real world. In other words, is it large enough to care about?

In closing, statistical significance indicates that your sample provides sufficient evidence to conclude that the effect exists in the population. Practical significance asks whether that effect is large enough to care about. Use statistical analyses to determine statistical significance and subject-area expertise to assess practical significance.

# VIF
**Variance inflation factor (VIF)** is a measure of the amount of multicollinearity in a set of multiple regression variables. Mathematically, the VIF for a regression model variable is equal to the ratio of the overall model variance to the variance of a model that includes only that single independent variable.
