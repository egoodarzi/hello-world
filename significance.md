# Statistical V.S. practical Significance [source](https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/practical-statistical-significance/#:~:text=While%20statistical%20significance%20relates%20to,in%20your%20field%20of%20study.)

Statistical significance **does not** necessarily mean that the results are 
practically significant in a real-worls sense of importance.

 it might seem logical that p-values and statistical significance relate to importance. However, that is **false** because conditions other than large effect sizes can produce tiny p-values.
## Practical Significance
While statistical significance relates to whether an effect exists, practical significance refers to the magnitude of the effect


# VIF
**Variance inflation factor (VIF)** is a measure of the amount of multicollinearity in a set of multiple regression variables. Mathematically, the VIF for a regression model variable is equal to the ratio of the overall model variance to the variance of a model that includes only that single independent variable.
