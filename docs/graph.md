#### keywords or unmentiond useful further material:
[Spektral](https://spektral.graphneural.network/) a Python library for Graph Neural Networks based on Keras and Tensorflow 2 developed by Daniele Grattarola.

## what is a graph?
we represent a graph by its vertxes and its links between vertexes, so a graph is represented by G(v, r)
### directed VS undirected graphs
how the edges link the nodes allws us t o distinguish between a __directed __ vs __undirected__ graph.\\
__complete graph__, where each node is connected to all other nodes.
